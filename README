Physics for Dart
----------------

Phart (PHysics for dART) is a general, multipurpose library meant for physics simulations using the Dart programming language.
(See http://dartlang.org/)

Much credit to http://gafferongames.com/ from which I take much of the concepts behind coding the RK4 integrator and much of the Quaternion class.
(Also some other non-essential things like the Cube example).

Please fork and give me pull requests if you want, I love for anyone to use this!
